# TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - Mini Project using Python
> Made using Tkinter 

Sentiment Analysis, also called opinion mining or emotion AI, is the process of determining whether
a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. Twitter has been growing in popularity and nowadays, it is
used every day by people to express opinions about different topics, such as products, movies,
music, politicians, events, social events, among others. Analysis of Twitter Sentiment using
python is done through python libraries like tweepy, sys, csv, re and textblob. For developing
a GUI application, tkinter is used. Statistical data representing the result of sentiment analysis
is presented using matplotlib python library.
